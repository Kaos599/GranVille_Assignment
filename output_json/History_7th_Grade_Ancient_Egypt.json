You can do this using special words called 'Boolean operators':\n\n*   **AND:** Use 'AND' to find results that include *both* words. For example, 'cats AND dogs' will show results about both cats and dogs.\n*   **OR:** Use 'OR' to find results that include *either* word. For example, 'pizza OR pasta' will show results about pizza, pasta, or both.\n*   **NOT:** Use 'NOT' to exclude results with a certain word. For example, 'cars NOT trucks' will show results about cars but not trucks."

For example, '!youtube funny cats' will search for 'funny cats' on YouTube."

For example, \"the quick brown fox\" will only show results that have that exact phrase.\n*   You can use parentheses ( ) to group search terms. For example, (cats OR dogs) AND food will find results about food for either cats or dogs. \n* You can use an asterisk * as a wildcard. For example, 'best * ever' will find results such as 'best movie ever' or 'best game ever'."
