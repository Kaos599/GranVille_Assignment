Here are a couple of tricks:\n\n*   **The \\ Trick:** If you type a backslash ( \\ ) before a word, like \\cats, DuckDuckGo will take you straight to the first search result for 'cats'. It's like a shortcut!\n*   **The ! Trick:** If you type an exclamation mark ( ! ) before something, like !youtube funny cats, DuckDuckGo will search YouTube directly for 'funny cats'. It's like telling DuckDuckGo to look on a different website."

            "heading": "Using 'AND', 'OR', and 'NOT'",
            "content": "These are like secret codes for searching! \n\n*   **'AND'**: If you want to find things that have BOTH words, use 'AND'. For example, 'dogs AND cats' will find things about both dogs and cats. Usually, if you just type two words, DuckDuckGo does the 'AND' for you. \n*   **'OR'**: If you want to find things about either one word or another, use 'OR'. For example, 'apples OR bananas' will find things about apples or bananas or both. \n*   **'NOT'**: If you want to find things that DON'T have a word, use 'NOT'. For example, 'cars NOT red' will find things about cars that are not red. "
