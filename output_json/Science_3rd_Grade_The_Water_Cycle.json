                "**Evaporation:** The sun warms up the water in rivers, lakes, and oceans. The water turns into a gas called water vapor and floats up into the air. It's like when you see steam coming from a hot bath!",
                "**Condensation:** The water vapor goes up high in the sky where it's cold. The water vapor turns back into tiny water drops and makes clouds. It's like when your breath makes fog on a cold day!",
                "**Precipitation:** When the clouds get too full of water drops, the water falls back to Earth as rain, snow, or hail. It's like when you water your plants!",
                "**Collection:** The rain, snow, or hail soaks into the ground or flows into rivers, lakes, and oceans. Then the cycle starts all over again!"
