            "content": "The water cycle has four main steps:\n\n*   **Evaporation:** The sun warms up the water in oceans, lakes, and rivers, and turns it into a mist called water vapor. It's like when you see steam coming from a hot bath!\n*   **Condensation:** The water vapor goes up into the air and cools down, turning back into tiny water drops and making clouds. Think of when you breathe on a cold window and it gets foggy.\n*   **Precipitation:** When the clouds get too full of water, they let it fall back down to Earth as rain, snow, or hail. It's like the sky is giving our planet a shower!\n*   **Collection:** The water that falls goes into oceans, lakes, and rivers, and then the cycle starts all over again! It's like the water is taking a big loop."
