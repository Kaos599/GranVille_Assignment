                "**Evaporation:** The sun heats up water in lakes, rivers, and oceans. The water turns into a gas called water vapor, like when you see steam from a hot bath.",
                "**Condensation:** The water vapor goes up into the sky and cools down. It turns back into tiny water drops and makes clouds, like when you see fog on a cold day.",
                "**Precipitation:** When the clouds get full of water, it falls back to Earth as rain, snow, or hail.",
                "**Collection:** The rain and snow collect in rivers, lakes, and oceans. Then the water cycle starts all over again!"
