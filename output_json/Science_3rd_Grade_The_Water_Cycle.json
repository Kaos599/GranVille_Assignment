            "content": "The water cycle has four main steps:\n\n*   **Evaporation:** This is when the sun heats up water in rivers, lakes, and the ocean, and turns it into a mist called water vapor. Imagine water turning into a steamy cloud!\n*   **Condensation:** The water vapor goes up into the sky and cools down. It turns back into tiny water drops and makes clouds. Just like when you see your breath on a cold day.\n*   **Precipitation:** When the clouds get too full of water, it falls back to Earth as rain, snow, or hail. It's like the clouds are taking a shower!\n*   **Collection:** The rain, snow, or hail lands on the ground and flows into rivers, lakes, and oceans. Then the cycle starts all over again!"
